# RG Stats Overview

This is the documentation for the RG-Stats TypeScript library.
Although this is primarily documentation for our API, if you're also just researching
how various stats work in rhythm games, we recommend looking at the [source code](https://github.com/TNG-dev/rg-stats) for this
library.

The library and documentation is maintained by [zkldi](https://github.com/zkldi) for [Tachi](https://tachi.rtfd.io).

!!! note
    Although this library was wrote for Tachi, it is completely decoupled from Tachi and can
    basically be used anywhere.

## Installation

Installing this library is possible through your preferred NodeJS package manager.


```sh
# npm
npm install rg-stats

# yarn
yarn add rg-stats

# pnpm
pnpm add rg-stats
```
 
`rg-stats` also comes with TypeScript definitions built in, as it is a TypeScript library.

## Contributing

To contribute, just clone the repository and make a pull request with your changes. Write tests if necessary,
and remember that we have a 100% test coverage rule for this library.

If you want to add a new algorithm or feature, please make an issue for discussion first.

Contributing to the docs is done in the same repository (it's a monorepo of `documentation/` and `library/`!).
